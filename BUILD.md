To build an executable, you need to first install [GNU Make]() on your OS

If ``make`` has been installed in the system already, then you can proceed to the next step

Run the following set of commands

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Equinoxtic/yield-converter.git 
$ cd yield-converter
$ make
$ ./yieldconverter
```

And that's pretty much it
